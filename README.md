*Core functions and methods for the harp ecosystem*

This package underlies everything in harp. It defines all of the
classes, generics and some methods used in the other harp packages, as
well as some functions that are needed in more than one of the harp
packages. The most important classes are:

- **geolist** - A list of 2d georeferenced fields.
- **harp_df** (and subclasses) - Data frames containing harp data.
- **harp_list** - A list of harp_df data frames.

Methods are defined for *most* [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
verbs.

In addition, functions for handling date-times, geographic
transformations of gridded data, data frame manipulations specific to
harp, meteorological formulae and smoothing 2d fields are included.

This package is automatically attached by all other harp packages.
